/**
 * Objects contained in a {@link Pool} must implement the Poolable interface and adhere to its
 * contract.
 *
 * <p>Pools call {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocate} on Allocators with the specific {@link
 * Slot} that they want a Poolable allocated for. The Slot represents a location in the pool, that
 * can fit an object and make it available for others to claim.
 *
 * <p>The contract of the Poolable interface is, that when {@link #release()} is called on the
 * Poolable, it must in turn call {@link Slot#release(Poolable)} on the specific Slot object that it
 * was allocated with, giving itself as the Poolable parameter.
 *
 * <p>The simplest possible correct implementation of the Poolable interface looks like this:
 *
 * <p>[source,java] -- public class GenericPoolable implements Poolable { private final Slot slot;
 * public GenericPoolable(Slot slot) { this.slot = slot; }
 *
 * <p>public void release() { slot.release(this); } } --
 *
 * <p>Memory effects: The release of an object happens-before it is claimed by another thread, or
 * deallocated.

public interface Poolable {
  /**
   * Release this Poolable object back into the pool from where it came, so that others can claim
   * it, or the pool deallocate it if it has expired.
   *
   * <p>A call to this method MUST delegate to a call to {@link Slot#release(Poolable)} on the Slot
   * object for which this Poolable was allocated, giving itself as the Poolable parameter.
   *
   * <p>A Poolable can be released by a thread other than the one that claimed it. It can not,
   * however, be released more than once per claim. The feature of permitting releases from threads
   * other than the claiming thread might be useful in message-passing architectures and the like,
   * but it is not generally recommendable because it makes it more complicated to keep track of
   * object life-cycles.
   *
   * <p>Great care must be taken, to ensure that Poolables are not used after they are released!
