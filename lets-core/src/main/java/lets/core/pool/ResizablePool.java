/**
 * ResizablePools are pools that can change their size after they have been created.

 * <p>All pools are configured with a certain size, the number of objects that the pool will have
 * allocated at any one time, and resizable pools can change this number on the fly. The change does
 * not take effect immediately, but instead moves the "goal post" and leaves the pool to move
 * towards it at its own pace.
 *
 * <p>No guarantees can be made about when the pool will actually reach the target size, because it
 * might depend on how long it takes for a certain number of objects to be released back into the
 * pool.
