 * This is the JMX management interface for Stormpot object pools.

 * MXBean, and not just an MBean, it imposes no requirement that external parties knows about the
 * Stormpot types.
 *
 * <p>Once you have created your pool, it is easy to expose it through the platform MBeanServer, or
 * any MBeanServer you like:
 *
 * <p>[source,java] -- BlazePool<MyPoolable> pool = new BlazePool<MyPoolable>(...); MBeanServer
 * server = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer(); ObjectName name = new
 * ObjectName("com.myapp:objectpool=stormpot"); server.registerMBean(pool, name); --
 *
 * <p>Using the platform MBeanServer will make the pool visible to tools like JConsole and VisualVM.
