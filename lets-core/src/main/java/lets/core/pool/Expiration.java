/**
 * The expiration is used to determine if a given slot has expired, or otherwise become invalid.
 *
 * <p>Note that Expiration instances must be thread-safe, as they may be accessed concurrently by
 * multiple threads. However, for a given {@link SlotInfo} and {@link Poolable} instance, only a
 * single thread will invoke the expiration at a time. This means that there is no need to
 * synchronise on the SlotInfo or Poolable objects.
 *
 * <p>The easiest way to ensure that an Expiration implementation is thread-safe, is to make sure
 * that they never mutate any state. If they do, however, then they must do so in a thread-safe
 * manner, unless the mutable state is contained within the SlotInfo or Poolable objects â€“ in this
 * case, the mutable state will be thread-local. Be aware that making the {@link
 * #hasExpired(SlotInfo) hasExpired} method {@code synchronized} will most likely severely reduce
 * the performance and scalability of the pool.
 *
 * <p>The Expiration can be invoked several times during a {@link Pool#claim(Timeout) claim} call,
 * so it is important that the Expiration is fast. It can easily be the dominating factor in the
 * performance of the pool.
 *
 * <p>TIP: If the expiration is too slow, you can alternatively use a time-based expiration, such as
 * {@link lets.core.pool.TimeExpiration}, that has been configured with a very low expiration time,
 * like a few seconds. Then you can configure the pool to use a {@link lets.core.pool.Reallocator},
 * where you do the expensive expiration check in the {@link
 * lets.core.pool.Reallocator#reallocate(Slot, Poolable) reallocate} method, returning the same
 * Poolable back if it hasn't expired. Be aware, though, that such a scheme has to be tuned to the
 * load of the application, such that the objects in the pool don't all expire at the same time,
 * leaving the pool empty.

   * <p>If the method throws an exception, then that is taken to mean that the slot is invalid. The
   * exception will bubble out of the {@link Pool#claim(Timeout) claim} method, but the mechanism is
   * implementation specific. For this reason, it is generally advised that Expirations do not throw
   * exceptions.
   *

   * @throws Exception If checking the validity of the Slot or Poolable somehow went wrong. In this
   *     case, the Poolable will be assumed to be expired.
